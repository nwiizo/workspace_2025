### Goal: Achieve 69kg Weight & Amateur Kickboxing Match 🥊

#### Nutrition Basics & Weight Management 📊
Carbohydrates, protein, and fat are the three macronutrients that become energy. When these are consumed in excess, it leads to weight gain. 7,200 kcal equals 1kg of weight gain.

Most people consume too many carbohydrates, so reduce those. Keep total intake above basal metabolic rate but below total daily energy expenditure. For adult males, that's around 1,500-2,000 kcal.

Protein builds muscle, so don't reduce it. Reduce fats and carbohydrates. That's it.
